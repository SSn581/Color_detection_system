# Color_detection_system
A color detection algorithm identifies pixels in an image that match a specified color or color range. The color of detected pixels can then be changed to distinguish them from the rest of the image.

The neccesary packages used in this model are following:
* 1. OpenCV
  2. Numpy
  3. Pandas
  4. Argparse

Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. Thus providing a csv file which have approximately 800+ color names along with their RGB and hex values.

# Image Used

I used the above image which is bascally colourful abstract art showing deferent colours

# Result Images
Folowing are the results how it detect the colour:

In the above result image you can see the white arrows and the squares which shows the places where the curser checked and the name of taht respective colors above the screen.
