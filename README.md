# Color_detection_system
A color detection algorithm identifies pixels in an image that match a specified color or color range. The color of detected pixels can then be changed to distinguish them from the rest of the image.

The neccesary packages used in this model are following:
* 1. OpenCV
  2. Numpy
  3. Pandas
  4. Argparse
